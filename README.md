==Organ Matching==
Authors: Yu Ju Liang, Trisha Huang.

===What is the problem?===
Each year, many patients are put on the waitlist for organ transplants. To find a matching organ for each patient, we must consider blood type, cell antigen type (HLA)  and whether donor organ and recipient are in the same city etc.. These factors are weighted differently due to the nature of organ transplant. For example, organ donor’s blood type must match with that of the recipient’s; therefore, it has higher priority than whether the location of organ and patient are in the same city.

Organ Matching finds a list of matching organs from the database for a patient, then ranks them based on the criteria listed above. If the core criteria is not matched (e.g. organ type, blood type etc.), then it will not be on the list rather than having a low ranking.

Donor organ attributes:
ID, city, blood type, HLA_A1, HLA_A2, HLA_B1, HLA_B2, HLA_DR1, HLA_DR2, living donor.

Recipient attributes:
ID, city, blood type, age, HLA_A1, HLA_A2, HLA_B1, HLA_B2, HLA_DR1, HLA_DR2, once a donor, PRA percentage

Sample sizes: 10 kidneys, 30 patients (using triple store).
Data generated by Java’s random number generator, with weighted scheme based on likelihood for blood type, age, city, PRA percentage.

===What is the something extra?===
Organ Matching not only searches for matching organs, it also ranks them based on a weighted scheme.

Possible extension: assign organs to a list of patients based on their highest ranking, and resolve conflicts when two or more patients have the same organ as their highest ranking. Waiting time and medical urgency of patients will be used to prioritize the matching.

===What did we learn from doing this?===
(This should be written after you have done the work.)  What is the bottom-line? Is logic programming suitable for (part-of) the task?  Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
